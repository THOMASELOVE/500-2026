If you have a question at any time once the course begins, send it by email to us at **500-help** at **case** dot **edu**.

I will generally be available for a half-hour after class on Thursdays for informal office hours. Just let me know during class if you're planning to chat with me after class.

We also have a teaching assistant, **Sarah Albalawi**. Sarah will hold her office hours on Sundays from 2:00 to 3:30 PM, and will be available to help you with issues regarding R and the assignments. Zoom information to join these office hours will be posted here, on our Shared Google Drive, and on Canvas, as soon as they are available.

Again, to contact us for anything related to the course, use **500-help at case dot edu**. If you need to email me directly, that's **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu**.
